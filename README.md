# terrible-ux-example

Overview
This website specification outlines the design and functionality for an intentionally unusable website, aiming to highlight the importance of good user experience (UX) by counterexample. The website is characterized by excessive pop-ups, poor color schemes, and overall terrible UX design.

General Design
Layout: The layout is intentionally cluttered and confusing. Elements overlap, and there is no clear visual hierarchy, making it difficult for users to discern where to focus their attention.
Color Scheme: The website uses a combination of neon colors that clash, creating a visually jarring experience. Text is often displayed in colors that barely contrast with the background, making reading difficult.
Fonts: Multiple competing and inconsistent font styles are used throughout the site. Font sizes vary dramatically, with some text too small to read and other text unnecessarily large.
User Interface (UI) Elements
Navigation: The navigation menu is overly complicated, with too many sub-levels that lead users in circles. Links are not clearly defined, and some navigate to dead ends or loop back to the homepage.
Buttons: Buttons are either non-functional or misleadingly labeled, leading to unexpected actions. They are placed randomly and inconsistently across pages.
Pop-Ups: Excessive pop-up windows appear frequently, interrupting the user experience. These pop-ups are difficult to close, with tiny or hidden "close" buttons, and sometimes reopening immediately after being closed.
Content and Functionality
Content Overload: Pages are overloaded with large amounts of text and images, with no clear organization or purpose. Content is often irrelevant or repetitive.
Broken Links and Features: Many links lead to error pages or are broken, serving no function. Features that users might expect to work, such as search bars or forms, either do not work at all or work in an unexpected manner.
Accessibility Issues: The website ignores basic accessibility principles, lacking alt text for images, having poor color contrast, and not being navigable with keyboard shortcuts.
Interaction Design
User Feedback: Feedback to user actions is either misleading or absent. For instance, clicking a button might not provide any indication that an action is being processed.
Load Times and Responsiveness: Pages load slowly, and the website is not optimized for different screen sizes or devices, leading to broken layouts on mobile devices or tablets.
